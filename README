Bambu Attachments
=================

A setup for handling generic model attachments

About Bambu Attachments
-----------------------

This package contains a simple set of models and admin helper classes
that allow you to add media attachments to any model.

About Bambu Tools 2.0
---------------------

This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_attachments``
rather than ``bambu.attachments``.

Installation
------------

Install the package via Pip:

::

    pip install bambu-api

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'bambu_attachments'
    )

Run ``manage.py syncdb`` or ``manage.py migrate`` to setup the database
tables.
